ðŸ“¦ TestCaseMig: LLM-Driven Test Case Migration for Evolving Codebases
TestCaseMig is a framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically migrate test cases when the underlying code changes. It combines static code analysis with LLM-based prompt generation and feedback-driven refinement to adapt outdated tests to updated programs.

ðŸŽ¯ Use Case:
When your code evolvesâ€”such as method updates or refactoringâ€”existing tests may break. TestCaseMig helps you fix and update those tests automatically, reducing manual effort and keeping CI pipelines healthy.

ðŸ“Œ Demo and dataset coming soon. Stay tuned!
